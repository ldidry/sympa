=head1 Domain correction

Users make common mistakes and typos on email addresses, like C<foo@gmail.fr>
instead of C<foo@gmail.com>.

You can define here some mistakes and typos that you want to automatically
correct before using them in list subscriptions.

To use that feature, set C<use_domain_correction> to 1 in C<sympa.conf>, copy
this file in Sympa's C<etc> directory then modify that copy.

Please note that this feature can only be use to correct the domains of the
email addresses, you can't change the user part of the email address.

=head2 Configuration

This file contains a Perl hash table containing two keys. Any other keys that
you could add won't be used, but you can delete one if you don't need it.

=over 1

=item B<substitutions>

Its value is a hash table, which keys will be the correct domains and the
values will be an array of mistyped domains.

Example:

    substitutions => {
        'hotmail.com' => ['hotamil.com', 'htmail.com']
    },

In this example, C<foo@hotamil.com> will be corrected in C<foo@hotmail.com>

=item B<globbing>

Its value is a hash table, which keys will be a mistyped domain pattern and
the values will be the correct domains.

B<Warning>: the pattern is not a regex, it's similar to shell globbing.
C<gmail.*> would match C<gmail.fr> but not C<gmailbar.fr>
See
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/perl-cookbook/1565922433/ch06s10.html

Example:

    globbing => {
        'gmail.*' => 'gmail.com',
    }

In this example, C<foo@gmail.fr> and C<bar@gmail.de> will be corrected in
C<foo@gmail.com> and C<bar@gmail.com>
